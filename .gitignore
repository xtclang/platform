# While we can still collect everyting into a common lib folder, as a final build step,
# if we want, the 'standard' Maven style way would be to just build and run the project.
# Every component declaratively states its dependencies to build and/or run, and any
# task using these dependencies gets them lazily resolved, and exactly what it needs,
# nothing more. We will likely implement a distribution config for XTC applications
# like this, of course, so that the old "lib" folder is some kind of versioned
# publishable artifact)
