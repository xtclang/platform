# Platform as a Service #

This is the public repository for the open source Ecstasy PaaS project, sponsored by [xqiz.it](http://xqiz.it).

## Status:

This project is being actively developed, but is not yet considered a production-ready release.

## Layout

The project is organized as a number of sub-projects, with the important ones to know about being:

* The *common* library (`./common`), contains common interfaces shared across platform modules. 
  
* The *kernel* library (`./kernel`), contains the boot-strapping functionality. It's responsible for starting system services and introducing them to each other. 
  
* The *host* library (`./host`), contains the manager for hosted applications.

* The *platformDB* library (`./platformDB`), contains the platform database. 

* The *platformUI* library (`./platformUI`), contains the end-points for the platform web-application. 
  
## Installation

1. Please follow steps 1-3 of the [XDK Installation](https://github.com/xtclang/xvm#installation).
2. Clone [the platform repository](https://github.com/xtclang/platform) to your local machine. For purposes of this document, we will assume that the project directory is `~/Development/platform/`, but you may use whatever location makes sense for your environment.

## Steps to test the PAAS functionality:

Note that steps 2 and 3 are temporary, and step 3 needs to be re-executed every time after an OS reboot.

1. Create "xqiz.it" subdirectory under the user home directory for the platform persistent data. The subdirectory "platform" will be used to keep the platform operational information and subdirectory "users" for hosted applications.

2. Create a file "~/xqiz.it/platform/port-forwarding.conf" with the following content:

       rdr pass on lo0 inet proto tcp from any to self port 80  -> 127.0.0.1 port 8080
       rdr pass on lo0 inet proto tcp from any to self port 443 -> 127.0.0.1 port 8090

3. Run the following command to redirect http and https traffic to unprivileged ports:
      
       sudo pfctl -evf ~/xqiz.it/platform/port-forwarding.conf

4. Make sure you can ping the local platform address:
       
       ping xtc-platform.localhost.xqiz.it
                                           
   The domain name `xtc-platform.localhost.xqiz.it` should resolve to `127.0.0.1`. This allows the same xqiz.it cloud-hosted platform to be self-hosted on the `localhost` loop-back address, enabling local and disconnected development.

   If that address fails to resolve you may need to change the rules on you DNS server. For example, for Verizon routers you would need add an exception entry for "127.0.0.1" to your DNS Server settings: "Exceptions to DNS Rebind Protection" (Advanced - Network Settings - DNS Server)   

5. Make sure you have the latest [gradle](https://gradle.org/), [node](https://nodejs.org/en), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and  [xdk-latest](https://github.com/xtclang/xvm#readme) installed. If you are using `brew`, you can simply say: 
        
        brew install gradle node yarn  

6. Change your directory to the `./platformUI/gui` directory inside the local git repo installed above.

        cd ~/Development/platform/platformUI/gui

7. Make sure all necessary *node* modules are installed within that directory using the following command:

        yarn install

8. If you plan to use `quasar` dev environment, please install it globally by the following command:

        npm install -g @quasar/cli
 
9. Build the platform services using the gradle command (from within the "platform" directory):

       cd ~/Development/platform/
       gradle clean build

10. Start the platform using the command (from within the "platform" directory):

        xec -L lib/ lib/kernel.xtc [password]

    Note: The password you choose during the very first run will be used to encrypt the platform key storage. You will need the same password for all subsequent runs.  

11. Open the [locally hosted platform web page](https://xtc-platform.localhost.xqiz.it): 

        https://xtc-platform.localhost.xqiz.it

    Note: Using the locally-created (self-signed) certificate from step 5 above, you will receive warnings from the browser about the unverifiability of the website and its certificate.

12. Follow the instructions from the [Examples](https://github.com/xtclang/examples) repository to build and "upload" a web application.

13. Log into the "Ecstasy Cloud" platform using the pre-defined test user "admin" and the password "password".

14. Go to the "Modules" panel and install any of the example module (e.g. "welcome.examples.org").

15. Go to the "Application" panel, register a deployment (e.g. "welcome") and "start" it  

16. Click on the URL to launch your application web page.

17. To control the hosting platform via the command line interface (CLI), start the command line tool:
    
    xec -L lib platformCLI.xqiz.it https://xtc-platform.localhost.xqiz.it admin:[password]

    Type "help" to see all available commands.

18. To stop the server cleanly, use a CLI "shutdown" command or from a separate shell run this:

        curl -k -b cookies.txt -L -i -w '\n' -X POST https://xtc-platform.localhost.xqiz.it/host/shutdown

    If you do not stop the server cleanly, the next start-up will be much slower, since the databases on the server will need to be recovered.

## PAAS in Docker #
> NOTE: Running the PAAS in Docker does NOT require port-forwarding as described above.
> In fact port-forwarding must be disabled/removed.

### Build

The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build with the official XDK base image from GitHub Container Registry.

#### Using Docker:
```shell
docker buildx build -t xtc-platform:latest .
```

#### Using Podman:
```shell
podman build -t xtc-platform:latest .
```

The build uses the official `ghcr.io/xtclang/xvm:latest` base image and builds the platform in three stages:
1. UI Builder - Compiles the Quasar web UI using Node.js 22
2. Platform Builder - Compiles all platform modules using Gradle with the XDK
3. Runtime - Creates the final minimal image with only the XDK and platform artifacts

The final image is approximately **142MB** in size.

**Note:** Cache mounts are used for npm and Gradle dependencies to speed up rebuilds. The first build downloads dependencies, but subsequent builds will be much faster.

### Run
#### username:password
The PAAS requires a username and password to login.
* The default username is **admin**
* This password is passed in using **-e PASSWORD=[password]**.

#### PAAS configuration
The networking part of the PAAS is configured with a JSON formatted file named **cfg.json**.
The PAAS is looking for the config file inside the container at **~/xqiz.it/platform**. 
If a **cfg.json** is already present then it will be loaded and processed.
Otherwise it will be created from the default template which is here [cfg.json](./kernel/src/main/resources/cfg.json) .

Docker allows mapping a host folder into the container. This allows accessing the files created by the PAAS.
It is suggested to use the same location as if the PAAS is run locally on the machine. 
Create the local folder which will be mapped by Docker. 
```shell
mkdir -p ~/xqiz.it
```
If you want to make changes to **cfg.json** then start the PAAS once,
locate the config file, amend it and restart the container to pick up the changes.

#### Run it for the first time
```shell
docker run -e PASSWORD=[password] -p 80:8080 -p 443:8090 -v ~/xqiz.it:/root/xqiz.it --name xtc-platform xtc-platform:latest
```

Or with Podman:
```shell
podman run -e PASSWORD=[password] -p 80:8080 -p 443:8090 -v ~/xqiz.it:/root/xqiz.it --name xtc-platform xtc-platform:latest
```

#### Restart
```shell
docker restart xtc-platform
```

Or with Podman:
```shell
podman restart xtc-platform
```

#### Stop
```shell
docker stop xtc-platform
```

Or with Podman:
```shell
podman stop xtc-platform
```

#### Teardown
Removing the container and the image in case they are not needed anymore
```shell
docker rm xtc-platform && docker rmi xtc-platform:latest
```

Or with Podman:
```shell
podman rm xtc-platform && podman rmi xtc-platform:latest
```

### Accessing the PAAS
Use the browser to access the PAAS e.g. https://xtc-platform.localhost.xqiz.it
